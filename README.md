## Background
This is a coding challenge for a frontend developer position at Novasol. The task is for us to see your coding skills and logical problem solving. If you pass the test then you will be invited to a second interview which will be based on your solution and will have a more technical focus.

## Starting the challenge

In the project directory, run these commands:

1. Install required packages
### `npm install`

2. Start local development server
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



## Requirements:
This coding challenge is based on a React application. You will have to use SCSS to style the UI (configuration has already been set up in webpack). Showcase your frontend skills to display this information in the best possible way.
There is no need for Redux or other state management libraries in this simple app, so go for built in state management options.

Please do use a version-control system (preferably git -- you can just zip the whole folder including the .git folder)

## Challenge description:
At Novasol, we rent out a lot of summer houses. We would like to see a nice looking list of summer houses on a webpage based on mocked data provided (mockData.json). Showcase your frontend skills to display the information in the best possible way.

## Task 1 (basic)
As a property manager at Novasol I want to be able to view properties and details on a web page. Create a nice looking list of properties that display this data.

Property details have following fields displayed:
<ul>
  <li>Property picture</li>
  <li>Property size</li>
  <li>Guest count that can be accomodated</li>
  <li>
    Address
    <ul>
      <li>Line1 (Required)</li>
      <li>Line2 (Optional)</li>
      <li>Postcode (Required)</li>
      <li>City (Required)</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Price per night</li>
</ul>

## Task 2 (mid level)
To make it easier to see where exactly those properties are located, we want you to display them on a map on a separate page. The page should display the map only, and basic navigation to go back to the main property list page.
Suggestion: You could use state to show the map without reloading the page. Responsive page is a bonus.

When a property marker is clicked, we want to see basic info of the property as well. Marker popup should display a box with property a small property image, property type, and address.

## Task 3 (advanced)

Complete the tasks according to your skill level. Show us your best and good luck!
